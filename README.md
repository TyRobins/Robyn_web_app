# Robyn's D&D 5th Edition Dice Roller (Web App)
This is a tool designed to calculate Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition dice rolls for a Tiefling Celestial Warlock in a *Descent Into Avernus* campaign.
As this constitutes my first foray into both tabletop gaming and Python programming, the primary goal here is to automate subtly varying calculations that I might otherwise be slow to distinguish in the midst of gameplay, and also enable me to practice programming skills in an applied setting between gaming sessions.
This version functions as a full stack web application, enabling other players to easily roll for my character in my absence.

## Future Improvements
- Automate rerolling for advantage and disadvantage.
- Add separate pages for other player characters in the campaign.
